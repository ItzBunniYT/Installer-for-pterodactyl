## Using the installation scripts

To use the installation scripts, simply run this command as root. The script will ask you whether you would like to install just the panel, just the daemon or both.

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://pterodactyl-installer.se)
```

_Note: On some systems, it's required to be already logged in as root before executing the one-line command (where `sudo` is in front of the command does not work)._

Here is a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8UJhyUFoHM) that illustrates the installation process.

## Firewall setup

The installation scripts can install and configure a firewall for you. The script will ask whether you want this or not. It is highly recommended to opt-in for the automatic firewall setup.

## Development & Ops

### Testing the script locally

To test the script, we use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com). With Vagrant, you can quickly get a fresh machine up and running to test the script.

If you want to test the script on all supported installations in one go, just run the following.

```bash
vagrant up
```

If you only want to test a specific distribution, you can run the following.

```bash
vagrant up <name>
```

Replace name with one of the following (supported installations).

- `ubuntu_focal`
- `ubuntu_bionic`
- `debian_buster`
- `debian_stretch`
- `centos_8`
- `centos_7`

Then you can use `vagrant ssh <name of machine>` to SSH into the box. The project directory will be mounted in `/vagrant` so you can quickly modify the script locally and then test the changes by running the script from `/vagrant/install_panel.sh` and `/vagrant/install_wings.sh` respectively.
